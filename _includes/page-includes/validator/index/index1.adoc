== Application layer agnostic validation

Hibernate Validator allows to express and validate application constraints. The default metadata source are
annotations, with the ability to override and extend through the use of XML. It is not tied to a specific
application tier or programming model and is available for both server and client application programming. But a
simple example says more than 1000 words:

[source,java]
----
public class Car {

@NotNull
private String manufacturer;

@NotNull
@Size(min = 2, max = 14)
private String licensePlate;

@Min(2)
private int seatCount;

// ...
}
